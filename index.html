She was influenced early on by her parents – who fled antisemitism in Poland in the 1920s. They fostered a creative, socially conscious home, where she grew up following both artistic expressions and an interest for justice. Her design practice spans printing, sketching, broadsheets, and photography, often centering on collaborative projects that empower people to share their experiences, such as public poster-making workshops addressing women’s comfort in shared spaces. As a pioneer of feminist design and an influential educator, she believes “teaching is a conversation much more than a lecture,” emphasizing the importance of listening and learning from others as part of the design process. Her work not only has reshaped design education, but also has inspired and continues to inspire others to embrace advocacy and courage in artistic expression.</span></h1><audio controls><source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your Browser does not support the audio element.</audio></body></html>
